Where On The Blue Marble?

Play the game on <http://whereonthebluemarble.com>!

Files include the front-end for the game as well as the scripts to get random photos from the database.

The game can give hints about what part of the world is shown in the photo. It tells users either which hemisphere or which continent. If you want to include the latter option, you should provide your own install of the Geonames world table as a Postgres database.
